Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program or world.



Functional Programming (FP) 

Example: (none FP)
==================
```typesript 
let score = 456;

function addBonus(){
    score = score + 45;
    return score;
}
```

Example:(FP)
=============

functionaddBonus(score){
    return score +45;
}
