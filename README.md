# Level Up Project

## Set up

        npm install fp-ts

- Make sure to always have a single version of fp-ts installed in your project. Multiple versions are known to cause tsc to hang during compilation. You can check the versions currently installed using 
        
        npm ls fp-ts 
        
- make sure there's a single version and all the others are marked as deduped.
